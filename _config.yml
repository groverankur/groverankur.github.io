  Hello! I'm a highly skilled enterprise/solution architect and data engineer with over 14 years of experience. With a passion for designing and implementing large distributed systems, technical consulting, project management, and technology implementation, I have a proven track record of delivering successful projects that drive business value.

  My technical expertise in Hadoop, Enterprise Information Management, Data Management, and Application integration, combined with my proficiency in data modeling, ETL, and data warehousing, has allowed me to design and build scalable data solutions that extract insights and drive innovation.

  But it's not just about the technical skills. I'm also a people person who enjoys working with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality work that exceeds expectations. My excellent analytical, team-working, project-management, communication, and organizational skills enable me to manage multiple priorities in fast-paced environments while maintaining a positive attitude.

  I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry, and I am committed to continuous learning and professional development.

  When I'm not working on exciting data projects, you can find me <mark>reading books</mark>. I believe that balance is key to a fulfilling life, both personally and professionally.
